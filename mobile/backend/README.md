### Basic Chat Bot

One of the initial features planned for Aria is the development of a basic chat bot. This chat bot will be capable of:

- Responding to simple user queries.
- Providing information based on predefined rules.
- Learning from interactions to improve responses over time.

The chat bot will serve as a foundation for more advanced features in the future.
